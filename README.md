This is a wip rust rewrite of the ink stroke format code using the following references

- the .NET source code viewer
here : https://source.dot.net/#PresentationCore/MS/Internal/Ink/InkSerializedFormat/InkSerializer.cs,127 I'm not sure what's the license is on this though. For reference only ? open promise only ?
- There is also the libisfqt library we can take inspiration from https://gitlab.com/kmess/libisf-qt/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads or https://github.com/blu-base/libisf-qt
- The official ink serialized format specification can be found here  https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/digformatspecs/InkSerializedFormat(ISF)Specification.pdf
